### Installation
Clone the GitHub repository to your local drive. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Usage
* Start creating your README by running `node index.js` in your terminal. From here, prompts will appear in the terminal asking for information about your project. Answer and press enter, and the next prompt will appear in terminal. Once all prompts are answered, your terminal will log a "Success" message and a NewREADMe.md file will be created in this folder.

* In GitBash or other command line tool, run `node index.js` to initiate the program. The first prompts will enquire the project you are wishing to render a README.md of. 

* You will be prompted with a series of questions on your project.

* Once you have answered all prompts, a NewREADME. will be created in the output folder.
